# OurCommerce
Single page e-commerce application using React, TypeScript, Redux for state management, and Redux Query for API calls. Users can view a list of products from 'https://fakestoreapi.com' and add products to a shopping cart. The shopping cart is stored locally so its data persists on refresh.
